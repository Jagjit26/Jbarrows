<br />
As a young cook I find myself charting growth and progress through milestones; sometimes you don&#39;t know their impact for months or years, other times it&#39;s immediately apparent. Last week&#39;s event with author/forager, &quot;Hero&quot; Hank Shaw, was a lot of both. His book, <a href="http://amzn.to/pUJlhZ">Hunt-Gather-Cook: Finding The Forgotten Feast</a> is an amazing piece of work, released at a perfect time in my career.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I&#39;m a California boy, born and raised. As a chef, I&#39;m spoiled rotten by our abundant farms and produce. While everyone else has been jumping on the &quot;buy local bandwagon,&quot; Californians have the luxury of saying &quot;yeah, so what?&quot; We take it for granted that so much is farmed, raised, and produced throughout this state.<br />
<br />
When Hank was preparing to release his book (that was <a href="http://bit.ly/q4fszT ">based on his blog</a> which I avidly follow), I reached out and did everything I could to bribe this two-time James Beard nominee to come up and do an event with us.&nbsp; Hank threw down a challenge, one that would cause me to have nightmares and anguish unlike any other menu; make a meal that can only be produced in this time and place -&nbsp;Hyper local, hyper seasonal.<br />
<br />
After pouring through his book (which inspired me to buy about five more guide books), I was astonished to find what an amazing array of edible plants we have in the Sierra Nevada mountains, Truckee, and the Tahoe Basin. Driving down the road I would find myself staring at wild flowers, wondering what it was, contemplating its taste and use. We all know the dangers of texting and driving, but after more people read Hank&#39;s book, we may need a few &quot;PSAs&quot; on <em>foraging while driving. </em><br />

<br />
I first met Hank in person the night before our event. I had just finished dinner service when I happened to spot a couple in our back parking lot closely studying all the wild vegetation that surrounds it. Hank was with his&nbsp;girlfriend, Holly, and they proceeded to point out an amazing array of wild flowers and greens that we had growing on the property including lamb&#39;s quarter, wild salsify, and yarrow.<br />
<br />
We hit it off immediately, over a couple tumblers of whisky, and later a <em>slight</em> over-indulgence of wine. Hank prefers Jameson, while Holly drinks Jack-on-the-rocks. Needless to say, I liked them both very much. The conversation quickly turned to food, foraging, and the following day&#39;s activities including a dinner inspired by Hank&#39;s book. The initial nerves were eventually calmed by a few drinks, good conversation, and an unmistakable&nbsp;omen sent directly from the food gods.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
While the three of us were sitting in Stella after hours, sipping wine and discussing the following night&#39;s menu, in through the back door walks a big black bear. The bear proceeds to sniff my stock pot, mosey around for a second and then knock over my sourdough starter (prick!). After all that, he didn&#39;t even have the common courtesy to pose for a picture as I frantically tried to pull my phone from my pocket. Holly does a <a href="http://norcalcazadora.blogspot.com/2011/07/so-bear-walked-into-restaurant.html">much better job of telling the story</a> then I do, so check out her post if you want more details. Needless to say, it was a poetic start to an epic event.<br />

Heyser - <a href="http://www.heyserphoto.com">www.heyserphoto.com</a></span><br />
<br />
The following day, Hank led a late morning hike on Sagehen Creek&nbsp;Trail teaching attendees how to identify <span>B</span><a href="http://bit.ly/ndvUsP ">lue Camas from Death Camas</a>, Sierra Yampa, Sweet Cicely, and Coyote Mint just to name a few. It was apparent upon their return, that the hikers had been bitten with the same &quot;foraging bug&quot; I had contracted a few weeks earlier. One thing we all have in common is that we eat on a daily basis; some just for sustenance, others for pleasure, and a few to experience it as an art. Once your eyes are open to this &quot;edible world&quot; around you, as Hank states in the opening line of his book, &quot;there really is no turning back&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think the common thread that we can all appreciate from Hank is his absolute passion for what it is he does. It&#39;s something you can&#39;t fake; either you have it or you don&#39;t. When he talks to you about foraging, hunting, fishing, his eyes light up with unadulterated delight, giving you the courage and desire to explore in more depth this &quot;edible world.&quot;<br />

<br />
Later that evening, attendees sat down to a tasting menu that was inspired by Hank&#39;s book and the local plants of the greater Tahoe region. Since trout can be found all around us in&nbsp;the area&#39;s lakes and streams, it seemed appropriate to lead with this fish. That, and the fact that it was my only option if I was going to take &quot;Hank&#39;s Challenge&quot; seriously. On most tasting menus, it&#39;s almost a given that you start with a fish course, or at least serve one early on in the tasting. Since &quot;the usual suspects&quot; are, at best, fished from an ocean about 200 miles from Stella, trout was the only fish really appropriate for this dinner.<br />
<br />
The trout cake was pretty classic if not damn tasty. It was topped with a spicy remoulade and garnished with a chiffonade of lamb&#39;s sorrel for a lemony bite and few spruce tips. The spruce tips were Hank&#39;s idea, and a brilliant one at that.<br />

<br />
The rabbit roulade was both mine and Hank&#39;s favorite dish of the night. For me, it was the distilled essence of my style with new influences drawn from Hank&#39;s book. Rabbits run wild all over Truckee; it&#39;s not uncommon to see them outside on my back patio, munching on all kinds of wild greens, looking simultaneously adorable and delicious as only rabbits can.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is, it was impossible to source local California rabbit through my purveyors. My only option through traditional means was meat imported from China. Yes, that&#39;s right, CHINA! That sort of defeats the whole purpose of this dinner, now doesn&#39;t it?<br />
<br />
Through extensive research I was able to find rabbit produced by <a href="http://bit.ly/o0tQ9G ">Devil&#39;s Gulch Ranch</a> in Marin County, and they were willing to ship direct. This rabbit was more then three times the price of the imported rabbit,&nbsp;&nbsp;but the quality was absolutely amazing.<br />
<br />
When removing the rabbit loin during the fabrication process, I was careful to leave the belly portion attached. This later allowed me to inlay heirloom baby carrots and blanched spinach along the loin and then wrap the belly around the filling, making a roulade. The left over rabbit carcasses were roasted and turned into a stock that was then reduced down to about one and a half quarts total before half a peach was added right at the end to give off a summery fragrance.<br />
<br />
The plate was garnished with a baby French radish pulled from Stella garden that afternoon, yampa flowers and carrot caviar--carrot juice that was sweetened with a mirepoix simple syrup and then gelled into &quot;caviar&quot; using basic ionic spherification. I originally wanted to use yampa root in this preparation, which was prized by our local Native American population, but it is better latter in the summer and into fall, after the flowers have turned to seed. The flowers however have a subtle, floral aroma and the flavor of a mild parsnip with a slight back hint of celery; very appropriate for a rabbit dish.<br />

<br />
This dish contained my new favorite ingredient; an ingredient that I had never even heard of until Hank&#39;s book: madrone bark. Madrone only grows in very select regions, one of which is the lower elevations of the northern Sierra Nevada&nbsp;mountain range. It most closely resembles a tall Manzanita bush and has red bark that bursts off the trunk during the mid-to-late summer months. The bark is most commonly made into teas with a wonderful aroma that&#39;s reminiscent of grandma&#39;s house after a Christmas Eve bake-a-thon.<br />
<br />
Spurred by an idea in Hank&#39;s book, I brined the duck breast in the Madrone tea overnight and it turned out great. If I had to take only one new ingredient away from this dinner, it would definitely be the Madrone bark. You&#39;ll be seeing this unique ingredient worked onto the Stella dinner menu in the near future.<br />
<br />
Also in his book, Hank has a great recipe for duck sugo, a meaty Italian sauce that traditionally consists of meat that is slowly simmered or braised in a tomato-based sauce. A portion of the meat is shredded, pulverized, and added back into the original braising liquid&nbsp;which&nbsp;acts as a <a href="http://www.stellaculinary.com/blog/thickening-agents-sauces-and-soups-reviewed">thickening agent</a>.<br />
<br />
The moment I read this recipe, I was immediately inspired to turn it into a ravioli filling. The overall dish was simple; the duck legs and offal make sugo, which is then stuffed inside the ravioli and the sous vide duck breast is served on top. Hank made the suggestion of brown butter and sage, a classic flavor combination that is often served with raviolis. We ended up dehydrating the brown butter using tapioca maltodextrin to control its flavor release and it was serendipitous that the sage plants in our garden had just gone to flower, providing an eye appealing and fragrant garnish.<br />

<br />
Venison is another animal living all over our area, but it was a battle for us to purchase anything locally- raised for the dinner. In fact, it was a battle that I ended up losing. When I Googled &quot;California Venision Farm,&quot; the first five pages of results were all related to dog food; hardly the level of respect such a beautiful animal should receive.<br />
<br />
Finally on page six, I not only found a venison farm in California, but in Grass Valley of all places.&nbsp;(A small town about 50 miles west of Truckee in the Sierra Nevada&nbsp;foothills.) I quickly called the number provided, only to reach a disheartened rancher that had sold off his heard the previous summer because demand for his premium meat had dropped off in the struggling economy. In the end, I decided to stay true to the overall &quot;theme&quot; of the dinner and was forced to import my venison from New Zealand.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve used New Zealand venison before and the quality is always solid and reliable. But I do find it slightly ironic that even though things like rabbit, venison, and trout are our area&#39;s birthright, it&#39;s more &quot;local&quot; for a Tahoe restaurant to serve chicken, beef, and pork.<br />
<br />
The venison rack was sauced with a currant demi glace (the currants being from our pastry chef&#39;s garden) and the flower blossoms of wild onions. The wild onion flowers have a crunchy texture and a flavor that closely resembles chives.<br />

<br />
We finished the dinner with a simple blackberry tart topped with prickly pear sorbet and pine nut brittle. Blackberries grow wild all throughout the lower elevations of the Sierra Nevada range, with the pine nuts being found as close as&nbsp;your backdoor if you&#39;re a Tahoe resident. Prickly pear is a Great Basin plant that grows in the arid, high deserts on the east side of the Sierra Nevada range. If you&#39;re interested in playing around with some prickly pear, there&#39;s a great little tutorial on how to prepare it in Hank&#39;s book. Do remember though, that it is a cactus and should be handled with care.<br />

<br />
The following morning, Hank, myself, and Holly met up to see if we couldn&#39;t track down a nice large field of Blue Camas. We found a beautiful, secluded meadow on the way to Sierraville that had a few good size patches of Camas and a plethora of Sierra Yampa. Hank wrote a <a href="http://bit.ly/ndvUsP">great post on the blue camas</a>, which I highly recommend.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Hank and Holly for helping us put on such a great event!&nbsp; We&#39;re already hard at work planing for the next time they&#39;re able to come to town.<br />
